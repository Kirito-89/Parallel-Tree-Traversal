## Instruction to run

### compile the code
``` bash
g++ traversal-cs23btech11001.cpp -o code
```
code expects a command line argument that will be the name of the file.

for example
``` bash 
./code input.txt
```

where input.txt is the name of the file containing the input.

        - contains the imput that is parameters and adjacenecy list of the graph
    ** output.txt **
        - will contains the output that needs to be shown like discover order, tree traversal, total traversal time
